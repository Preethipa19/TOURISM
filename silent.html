<div><p>Silent Valley Munnar is a beautiful green space in the Nilgiri hills of Palakkad district in Kerala, Mannarkkad. You will see the most amazing view of tea plantations and uphill and downhill slopes on the way to Silent Valley. You can also find various types of flora and fauna in this national park.<br></p>
<p>From the name itself it attracts tourists towards it and when they reach here, they simply fell in love with it. Let us clear that we are mentioning about the Silent Valley, near Munnar, Kerala and not about the Silent Valley National Park located in Nilgiri Hills, Mannarkkad, in the Palakkad District of Kerala. Both of these are two different places but equally eye-catching. The Silent Valley is a stunning green landscape and named as it is found inside the Silent Valley Tea Estate.</P>
<p>While your visit to the Silent Valley you get to see green landscape with mountains and Eucalyptus forests. On the right side notice the second highest peak in South India – the Meesapulimala. It is a cold rivulet flowing amid the landscape. The soothing view of buffaloes’ and cows’ grassing would force you to stay here for a longer time than planned. Mollywood’s favorite shooting spots is this valley and have featured in various south Indian movies.</P>

<p>On your drive to the Silent Valley you would witness the best picturesque exquisiteness of tea farms and rising and falling hills. Another attraction of this road is the wild elephants roaming freely and quietly. If you happen to be lucky enough, you can also see them crossing the road. There are a few tour operators in Munnar who offer a “Night Jeep Safari” to see wild animals on the same road.</P></div>
